      <h2>My Assessment</h2><!--Hey Thomas!-->
      <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
      <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
      <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>
      <h4>Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the &quot;title&quot; attribute. </h4>
      <p>The "alt" attribute is shown in the place of an image that cannot be displayed while the 
        "title" attribute is often shown as a tool tip while the image is being displayed. They are 
        different and can be used separately or together.</p>
      <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>
      <p><b>dic&#8729tion&#8729ar&#8729y</b>
